# Handwritten Digit Recognition Tensorflow

Handwritten Digit Recognition which is trained using dataset provided by MNIST. This project is powered by deep learning and TensorFlow tools to train and build models based
on the MNIST handwriting dataset.

## About the dataset

The MNIST dataset is provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST). The dataset consists of handwritten digits from 250 individuals, of which 50% are highschool students and 50% are staff from Bureau of the Census. <br>
